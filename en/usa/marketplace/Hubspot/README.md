### Custom Matching Employee <br />

_Incoming calls are forwarded to the Contact Owner (personal manager) identified in HubSpot._

- Automatic matching: After integration, employees are automatically mapped and calls are forwarded based on user's email.
- UI matching: Manually match employees in the UI, and these mappings will take precedence over automatic matching.

<details>
<summary style="font-weight:bold;">Entity Creation Settings (Chats)</summary> <br />

- **Most settings for creating entities in chats are similar to calls, with a few key differences:**
<br /><br />

  - Entities are created once per chat session, triggered by either a client or employee first message, regardless of the number of messages exchanged before the chat closes.
  <br /><br />
  - When a client sends the first message, no employee is assigned yet, so an owner can’t be set. The owner can be updated after an employee replies, if enabled in the integration. 
  <br /><br />
  - If the client’s phone number is hidden, only a Ticket can be created, provided the integration settings allow it. Otherwise, nothing is created.
